<p id="p2"> If I see this course not just as an opportunity to apply learning science to a particular TLL project/practicum, but this reflection/portfolio as part of the application of learning science to the course, then the creation of this portfolio is a constructivist/constructionist exercise. Having had some experience building apps using learning opportunities that have been unstructured or unsupported by a community, (YouTube tutorials, Udemy courses) I’ve wanted to build a dynamic personal website for over a year, as a way to challenge myself to create something that looks beautiful in addition to functioning efficiently, because I often neglect the visual appearance of products. This e-portfolio became an opportunity to use some of the experience I’ve gained previously working with the Angular framework (combines HTML, CSS and Javascript) to create websites that adapt to different users. This is obviously a constructionist exercise because I’m learning about myself and my relationship to the world through the act of building the site (currently in the phase of excitement) and a constructivist exercise because I’ve relied on reIationships to make the creation of the site a reality. I have to thank Varsha from our class for helping me to actually implement my template to a functional site, I would have found the process extremely frustrating without her support.</p>
<p id="p2">My understanding of learning science has deepened from the readings we’ve covered over the first three weeks of the course. The Moulton article is an excellent ‘forever resource’, its brief coverage of so many useful references from learning science provide many doors to open to explore learning science further. Teaching in a Digital Age is an interesting resource because it combines learning science with the practical environmental/industrial shifts that make digital education important and learning science in the digital context specifically interesting. While I was familiar with the different philosophical perspectives that underpin pedagogy - behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, constructionism etc - I think the deeper dive has helped me appreciate the validity of all of them in particular contexts and recognise my own biases for and against particular philosophies (my eye’s on you, behaviorism).</p>   

<p id="p2">For my project, I was keen to work on a project that allowed me to develop a product/aspect of a product from the ideation to prototyping phase, as well as being relevant to contexts of professional skilling. Therefore, I thought the digital badging project was particularly interesting, as it allowed me to work on a component of online courses that I believe have been relatively ignored - how do we create certifications of learning that deeply capture the learning that has taken place, more than a grade.</p>

<div *ngIf="isShown2">

<p id="p2"> Over the past couple of weeks I’d been thinking about 1) covering the blind spots in my learning; and 2) deciding on areas of exploration within digital badging
</p>
<p id="p2">In the past, when designing learning experiences, I’d find myself unconsciously supporting an imagined learner that was very similar to myself. While this had the advantage of being quite thoughtful for such a learner, it didn’t account for other modes of learning/approaches to learning and strategies that I myself might find useful but hadn’t explored. For example, I have resisted using behaviorist learning approaches because I am not philosophically aligned to behaviorism, even though I must now acknowledge that I do believe behaviorism is useful in certain contexts. Additionally, because I have had a fairly good memory in traditional academic settings, I haven’t had the need for using tools like chunking, even though it could have made my learning more efficient/deeper, and therefore haven’t thought of including it in learning experiences that I have designed.
    As an exercise while at HGSE, I will try to design learning experiences that incorporate philosophies that I have less exposure to/less affinity towards. Ones that I have explored are cognitivism, constructivism and now constructionism, through my Digital Fabrication course. I would like to explore behaviorism and connectivism as well.

<p id="p2">For the Practicum, I am working on the Digital Badging project. As mentioned in my previous reflection, I’m interested in professional skilling, therefore am curious about exploring alternative credentials. The open-ended scope of this project is exciting, but I’m quickly realising that I need to maintain a narrow scope to produce something fairly tangible by the end of the semester. The prior work on the topic has been to understand T127 learner needs from a learning design badging system, which is a valuable place to jump off from, but I will also conduct some supplementary user research of my own, in the form of surveys. In addition to primary research, I am also reviewing the literature from the past 3 years on digital badging to understand what the contemporary perspectives on the uses and challenges with digital badging are.</p>

<p id="p2"> Over the past 2 weeks we’ve covered parts of the Design module, referring to different design models, such as ADDIE, backward design and IDEO’s approach. I find these different models fairly similar at their cores, which makes me question the value of having this variety of models. I think the major addition that has been made is the explicit mention of “empathy” in IDEO’s framework, as design has in the past neglected the perspectives of those intended to use the designed services or products.
</p>
<p id="p2">We also discussed different forms of assessment which enhance learning and test competency. One thing that has struck me is the emphasis on offering learners different modalities in which to demonstrate competency in the same domain. When designing learning experiences in the past I have tried to implement the “cognitive apprenticeship” approach by creating opportunities for assessment which closely mimic the actual area of application (e.g. when implementing a module on piloting interventions, participants actually conducted micro-pilots in their organisations), however, I haven’t offered multiple modalities for expression, which I can see was a limitation. At the same time, I do see the challenge of implementing multiple modalities at scale, because it requires deep shared understanding of rubrics that assess different kinds of work, which means that these rubrics must also necessarily be less specific than the rubrics we have in traditional learning environments, which assess a single kind of work.
    </p>
<p id="p2">For the Digital Badging project I am working on creating a badging system that captures the learning design competencies/experiences that any student in the TLL Practicum could potentially acquire during the semester. These badges should also be valuable for students to potentially show to employers. As a first step, I am looking at the different design models to create a consolidated set of learning design competencies, as I believe that between the different frameworks the variety of learning design competencies are broadly accounted for.</p>

    <p id="p2"> In class we’ve been covering media creation for the purpose of learning experiences, and my big take away has been that less is often more. What I mean is that a learning experience does not need to be, probably should not be, packed with novel or complex media for it to be enriching. This resonates with the principle of cognitive load - there’s a limited processing capacity of working memory, so don’t waste it! Having a variety of media can be engaging, which is necessary for learning, but can distract from the core learning content, creating extraneous load - unnecessary effort. I’ve started looking at lecture slides quite differently, consciously seeing where the inclusion of a fun meme, while making students laugh and stay engaged, also moves attention away from the essential learning ideas.
        As touched on here, there can be a tradeoff between media and maintaining germane load - relevant effort for learning. Since a necessary condition for learning is attention/engagement, a captivating GIF that gets a group focussed on the learning experience can be valuable, even if it slightly adds to the extraneous load. I think this captures a larger learning that I’ve had during the course, which is that I cannot aim to create a learning experience that optimises for all the different learning theories, but should try to understand the tradeoffs when implementing different theories and manage them appropriately for the particular learning experience.
    </p>
    <p id="p2">Having outlined the seven learning design competencies that I believe encompass the learning design competencies that a potential Practicum student could acquire, I have been creating authentic assessment opportunities mapped to each competency. As per the guidelines for authentic assessment mentioned in a previous reflection, I have attempted to offer a variety of forms and modalities of demonstration of competency. For example, offering audio reflections instead of written ones, or enabling different forms of learner profiles, depending on the preference of the TLL student. Based on feedback from Prof. Wisser and Hope, I will focus on one of the competencies - user research/needs analysis - to develop a comprehensive badge prototype which includes criteria for attainment as well as sample exemplar work, to create transparency regarding the requirements for an awardee of the badge.

    <p id="p2"> The semester came to a close with the T127 Gallery Walk, when we were able to share our work with the rest of the T127 group as well as drop-in visitors. Before the gallery walk, we had a dry run for our gallery walk presentations, when we received feedback on the content and structure of our presentations. The dry run was a reminder of the value of timely feedback in learning, because the rapid rounds of feedback made a significant impact on my final presentation, even though it had not been substantially completed before the dry run.
    </p>
    <p id="p2">The gallery walk itself was a great opportunity to review my learning from the semester, through the pieces of my Capstone project. As I had worked independently on an exploratory project, it wasn’t clear what distinguished my Capstone from the rest of my Practicum work over the semester. It was exciting to get feedback and thoughts on the possibility of using digital badging for TLL Practicum students in the future. Many of the questions led to discussions around feasibility, since most attendees seemed to find intrinsic value in the idea of using badges/competency-based credentials in addition to traditional credentials.
        </p>
    <p id="p2">As the course comes to an end, I’d like to thank Prof. Wisser and Hope for their support and guidance on my capstone, and the teaching team for all the learnings around edtech over the semester. Lastly, thanks to my classmates for the feedback and discussions!
