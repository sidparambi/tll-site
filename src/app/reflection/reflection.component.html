<p id="p1"> Reflection 1</p>
<p id="p2"> If I see this course not just as an opportunity to apply learning science to a particular TLL project/practicum, but this reflection/portfolio as part of the application of learning science to the course, then the creation of this portfolio is a constructivist/constructionist exercise. Having had some experience building apps using learning opportunities that have been unstructured or unsupported by a community, (YouTube tutorials, Udemy courses) I’ve wanted to build a dynamic personal website for over a year, as a way to challenge myself to create something that looks beautiful in addition to functioning efficiently, because I often neglect the visual appearance of products. This e-portfolio became an opportunity to use some of the experience I’ve gained previously working with the Angular framework (combines HTML, CSS and Javascript) to create websites that adapt to different users. This is obviously a constructionist exercise because I’m learning about myself and my relationship to the world through the act of building the site (currently in the phase of excitement) and a constructivist exercise because I’ve relied on reIationships to make the creation of the site a reality. I have to thank Varsha from our class for helping me to actually implement my template to a functional site, I would have found the process extremely frustrating without her support.</p>
<p id="p2">My understanding of learning science has deepened from the readings we’ve covered over the first three weeks of the course. The Moulton article is an excellent ‘forever resource’, its brief coverage of so many useful references from learning science provide many doors to open to explore learning science further. Teaching in a Digital Age is an interesting resource because it combines learning science with the practical environmental/industrial shifts that make digital education important and learning science in the digital context specifically interesting. While I was familiar with the different philosophical perspectives that underpin pedagogy - behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, constructionism etc - I think the deeper dive has helped me appreciate the validity of all of them in particular contexts and recognise my own biases for and against particular philosophies (my eye’s on you, behaviorism).</p>   

<p id="p2">For my project, I was keen to work on a project that allowed me to develop a product/aspect of a product from the ideation to prototyping phase, as well as being relevant to contexts of professional skilling. Therefore, I thought the digital badging project was particularly interesting, as it allowed me to work on a component of online courses that I believe have been relatively ignored - how do we create certifications of learning that deeply capture the learning that has taken place, more than a grade.</p>
